# Minecraft Python
---
I recreated Minecraft in Python and only one dependency was used and it was Ursina. 

This remake only includes breaking blocks, moving, and jumping. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsbr0dyy.minecraft-python
```
and to install Ursina

```bash
pip install ursina
```

and to run the game do

```bash
cd minecraft-python
python minecraft.py
```
